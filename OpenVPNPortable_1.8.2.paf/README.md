# Getting Started
To get openvpn working you have to create a .ovpn file and ssl-keys to ./data/config directory. A HowTo for this you can find on [openvn.net](http://openvpn.net/howto.html)

## Installation
Download and start OpenVPNPortable_x.x.x.paf.exe. It doesn't install anything on your system. It just downloads and extracts the needed files to one directory.

To avoid downloading during install you have to do this before you start the paf.exe:
1. Download the binary package and the current.txt from [sourceforge.net](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ovpnp/files/binpack/)
2. place all the files in one single directory
3. Start the OpenVPNPortable_x.x.x.paf.exe in the console and add `/BINPACKURL=.` as parameter.

## Update
Just start OpenVPNPortable_x.x.x.paf.exe again. It checks your version with the one on [sourceforge.net](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ovpnp/files/binpack/) and updates if needed.

## Usage
All you need to do is double click OpenVPNPortable.exe to start.

If you want to connect on program startup, disable the splash or some settings else, edit OpenVPNPortable.ini to change the behaviour of OpenVPNPortable.
